# ImageCompressionKMeansClusteringCourseraColab
Though this is a coursera project, I have added my own photos for its image compression and used google colab to do this project.
Also the coursera code didnot have flexibility to use other photos due to the image sizes. I have added this additional part where other photos can also be compressed by changing the size constraint.
